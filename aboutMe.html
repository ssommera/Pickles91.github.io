									<p>console.log("Hello World!");</p>
									<p>My name is Stephen Sommer, and I recently graduated from Winona State University in May 2024 with a degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing my Masters in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Michigan, where I am deeply immersed in exploring advanced concepts and applications in AI.</p>
									
									
									<p>At Fastenal, my specialization as an AI Developer revolves around creating sophisticated AI models and algorithms. My primary responsibility is to design and develop intelligent software solutions utilizing machine learning frameworks. I focus on harnessing Python and Java programming languages, alongside cloud technologies such as Microsoft Azure, to craft advanced AI models and applications. I leverage Spring Boot for efficient application development and Terraform for managing infrastructure, ensuring scalable and dependable AI solutions. Additionally, I conduct thorough testing and optimization using tools like Postman to deliver high-performance software that enhances automation, decision-making processes, and operational efficiencies across the organization.</p>	
									
									
									<p>My fascination with AI lies at the intersection of technology and philosophy, where the intricacies of machine learning and the quest to understand the human mind converge. Exploring the philosophy of AI illuminates questions about consciousness, ethics, and the nature of intelligence itself. I am captivated by how machines learn, from fundamental algorithms to complex neural networks, unraveling the mysteries of how artificial systems acquire knowledge and make decisions. The Turing Test, a pivotal concept in AI, intrigues me deeply as it challenges the boundary between human and artificial intelligence, prompting profound reflections on what it means to think and comprehend in an increasingly automated world. These interests drive my exploration into the profound implications of AI, shaping my vision of its potential to redefine human existence and societal structures.</p>

									<h2>Embarking on my AI Journey: Passion, Exploration, and Cognitive Inquiry</h2>
									<p>My journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence began with a childhood fascination for technology's potential. From an early age, I was captivated by computers and their ability to tackle intricate challenges. Inspired by a friend who introduced me to building computers, I embarked on my path by majoring in computer science at my local community college. Engaging in coding competitions, exploring online resources, and undertaking diverse projects, I focused increasingly on artificial intelligence (AI). The allure of AI's capability to simulate human-like intelligence and solve complex problems fueled my passion. This specialization not only deepened my technical expertise but also fostered a dedication to exploring the cutting-edge advancements and ethical considerations within AI. It's this pursuit that drives me forward as an AI scientist, eager to contribute to the future of AI technology</p>

									<h2>Exploring AI Creativity and Ethical Considerations Through Practical Projects</h2>
									<p>My hobbies reflect a blend of analytical curiosity and philosophical contemplation inspired by my passion for AI. I enjoy delving into programming and experimenting with algorithms, seeking to understand the intricate mechanics of machine learning models. Additionally, I find myself drawn to philosophical discourse surrounding AI ethics and consciousness, engaging in deep discussions and exploring various perspectives on these complex topics. Beyond theoretical exploration, I indulge in practical projects where I apply AI concepts to creative endeavors, such as developing AI-driven art or interactive simulations. These hobbies not only satisfy my intellectual curiosity but also allow me to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the implications of AI in society and the future of technology</p>

									<h2>Career Aspirations: Advancing AI Research at the Intersection of Cognitive Science and Philosophy</h2>
									<p>My career goal is to become an AI researcher specializing in cognitive science and philosophy, where I can delve into profound questions about the intersection of artificial intelligence and human cognition. I am fascinated by the philosophical implications of AI advancements, particularly in understanding consciousness, identity, and the ethical considerations surrounding AI's impact on society. I aspire to contribute to cutting-edge research that not only pushes the boundaries of AI capabilities but also deepens our understanding of the human mind and its interaction with technology. Whether in academic research, industry, or interdisciplinary collaborations, I aim to explore fundamental questions such as what it means to be conscious, whether a machine could possess self-awareness, and how AI can enhance or challenge our understanding of human cognition. Ultimately, I seek to shape the ethical and philosophical discourse surrounding AI while driving innovation in this rapidly evolving field.</p>
