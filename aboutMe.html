									<p>console.log("Hello World!");</p>
									<p>My name is Stephen Sommer, and I'm a detail-oriented Computer Science student at Winona State University. I'm passionate about technology and love exploring its endless possibilities.</p>
									<p>As a former Assistant in the Computer Science Department at Winona State University, I helped students and professors with their research projects, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field. This experience allowed me to gain valuable skills in project management, collaboration, and problem-solving, which I continue to apply in my current work as a Web Developer and in my future career goals as a Computer Scientist and Professor.</p>	
									<p>As a Web Developer in the Computer Science Department at Winona State University, I maintain and enhance the WSU Computer Science website. This involves addressing issues and refining functionalities, utilizing a skill set that encompasses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.</p>
									<p>In my role as a Developer at Fastenal, I design, develop, modify, and test relevant applications using .NET, ASP.NET, C#, JQuery, Oracle, MS SQL, and APIs. I take pride in creating software that solves real-world problems and enhances the user experience.</p>	
									<p>As President of the WSU Computer Science Club, I'm responsible for organizing events and workshops that bring students together to share their knowledge and passion for technology.</p>	
									
									<p>My interests in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, machine learning, and neural networks inspire me to keep learning and exploring new ideas. I'm excited about the future of technology and eager to make a meaningful impact in the field.</p>

									<h2>How I started my Computer Science journey</h2>
									<p>My computer science journey began with a curiosity for technology. As a child, I was captivated by the power of computers and their ability to solve complex problems. Inspired by a friend who showed me how to build a computer, I pursued computer science by majoring in it at the local community college. I participated in coding competitions, sought additional resources online, and worked on various projects to improve my skills. Along the way, I discovered the broader significance of computer science, exploring areas like networks, databases, AI, and cybersecurity. This multidisciplinary approach has shaped me into a well-rounded computer scientist, driven by problem-solving and a passion for innovation.</p>

									<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
									<p>
										In addition to my computer science pursuits, I have a diverse range of hobbies that bring joy and balance to my life. Playing musical instruments is one of my favorite pastimes, whether it's strumming the guitar, playing the piano, or experimenting with drum beats. Music allows me to express myself creatively and unwind. I also find solace in the great outdoors, spending my free time hiking and exploring nature. The tranquility of the trails, stunning vistas, and sense of adventure captivate me. Additionally, I have a passion for video games. Gaming provides me with a unique form of entertainment and escapism. I enjoy immersing myself in virtual worlds, exploring intricate narratives, and engaging in challenging gameplay. It not only allows me to relax and unwind but also fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills. Whether it's building my own gaming rig or competing in multiplayer matches, video games are a cherished hobby that adds excitement and variety to my life. These hobbies provide a welcome balance to the digital world of computer science, allowing me to recharge and find inspiration in different forms of expression.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>My Career Goals</h2>
									<p>My ultimate career goal is to become a Computer Scientist and a Computer Science professor. I'm driven by the desire to push the boundaries of knowledge in the field, and I believe that teaching and mentoring the next generation of computer scientists is a crucial part of that. To achieve this goal, I plan to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, where I can deepen my understanding of the field and contribute to cutting-edge research.</p>
